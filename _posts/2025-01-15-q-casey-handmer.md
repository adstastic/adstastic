Quoting [Casey Handmer](https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/2024/09/04/entrepreneurship-changed-the-way-i-think/):

> Thereâ€™s no limit to what you can achieve if you surrender credit for ideas. Ideas are cheap. Execution is what matters.

> There is no limit to the quantity of skepticism, paranoia, and pessimism you must brutally apply to your own ideas, particularly your favorite ones. The market will be harsher!
