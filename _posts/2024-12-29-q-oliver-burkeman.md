[Quoting Oliver Burkeman](https://ckarchive.com/b/68ueh8hkxrx6lukq88gqmtz7vxkkk):

> Had I put this feeling into words, it would have gone roughly as follows: “This is amazing! This is the kind of experience I love, so I want to make sure I’m getting the most from it, and I especially want to make sure that I keep on having this sort of experience repeatedly for the rest of my life!”, which, needless to say, is a sub-optimal way to be present in the moment. Mainly, though, the feeling in question wasn’t a matter of words. It was more of a clenching or a gripping, an attempt to grasp the moment and bring it under my ownership – which caused it, unsurprisingly, to draw back from me instead.

> Buddhist psychology is uniquely insightful, I think, when it comes to the specific version of clenching I was experiencing on that hillside path: how we make ourselves miserable, not just by railing against bad experiences, or craving experiences we aren’t having, but by trying too hard to hold onto the good experiences we _are_ currently having.

> Perhaps you’ve had the experience of reaching the end of a day on which you’d been unusually successful in getting your work done, or sticking to your fitness routine, but then instead of thinking “What a great day!”, you think: “That’s the kind of day I’m aiming for, and now it’s my job to make sure I keep on having more and more of them!” The result: you turned a potential source of easy delight into a source of further stress.

> experiences are for having, not for hoarding.

> “we cannot get anything out of life. There is no outside where we could take this thing to. There is no little pocket situated outside of life”

> Spending your days trying to get experiences “under your belt”, in an effort to maximise your collection of experiences, or to feel more confident about the future supply of similar experiences, means placing yourself in a position from which you can never enjoy them fully, because there’s a different agenda at play.

> Our clenching is never going to succeed in causing anything to become permanent. 

> Great attention should be given to a tea gathering, which we can speak of as ‘one time, one meeting’ (_ichigo, ichie_). Even though the host and guests may see each other often socially, one day’s gathering can never be repeated exactly. Viewed this way, the meeting is indeed a once-in-a-lifetime occasion. 

> This shouldn’t be confused with the claim that life on such days is a matter of unbroken good cheer. After all, it’s _sad_ that a beautiful moment passes and vanishes forever, that you can’t stash it away for permanent safekeeping! But it’s the kind of sadness that might otherwise be described as “poignancy”: a feeling that deepens the experience you’re having, rather than detracting from it. The kind of feeling you get once you’re no longer grasping and clutching at the moment – thereby, ironically, driving it further away from you – but stepping fully into it, experiencing yourself as a part of it, _being_ it.
