I've had unprecedented flexibility over my time since I quit my job to take some time off.
I finally got the blank canvas of the empty calendar I sought. 
Free of the restrictions of work, I wanted to do so many things.
I started so many of them. Now, many moons later, that's how they remain.
Once the novelty wears off, it's easy to get stuck in a rut. 

tl;dr Stop making excuses and finish your damn projects. Here's how.

Too busy? Too many other commitments? Too much life admin? Too tired?
Fine, drop the project.


## Get real
It's not what you want to do, it's what you actually do, that really defines you.
It doesn't matter that you want to 

* Commitment > motivation
* Procrastination expands to fill whatever volume it is given
* The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step
* Memento mori

All or nothing
Refuse to do ANYTHING else until your priority project is done. Yes, anything. Watch your productivity skyrocket.
Commitment trumps motivation
Feeling inspired is overrated. Decide what's important and stick to it. Everything else can wait.
The blank calendar is a lie
"Procrastination expands to fill whatever volume it is given." Structure your time, don't just clear it.
One foot after another
Finish one thing, then the next, then the next. Until you die. It's that simple.
Face your mortality

Getting things done feels good. It builds confidence. The specific project doesn't matter as much as breaking the pattern of starting and not finishing.
You have more time than you think, but you won't get anywhere if you keep changing direction every day.
So, what's your most important project? If someone paid you, would you finish it? Would you prioritize it above interruptions? If not, admit that incentives aren't the problem. There's some reason you don't want to get it done. Figure that out and deal with it.
