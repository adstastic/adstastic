title: Having my BRP and Passport stolen in Barcelona
tags: [travel, crime, log]

_This is an account of my recent experience of having my backpack with all my possessions (including my passport and BRP) stolen whilst on holiday in Barcelona._

## Prelude

My parents were visiting my sister & I in winter 2019, and we wanted to travel somewhere warm to enjoy better weather than the UK. After much searching we chose Spain, planning a week long trip starting and ending in Barcelona, with a few days in Costa Brava and Valencia. Over the past decade, we’ve had a holiday pattern of picking a few destinations within driving distance and renting a car to get around, so this was a pretty normal holiday for us. It was also our second such trip to Spain, and my second time in Barcelona.

On the 15th of December 2019, we flew to Barcelona and checked into our AirBnB. Barcelona is infamous for pickpockets (and much more, as we learned) so we left our travel documents and nonessential bank cards, etc in the safe at the AirBnB whilst we roamed the city. After a few nice days of eating and sightseeing, we packed and got ready to leave Barcelona on 19th December.

## Day 0 - Thursday 19th December

We collected the rental car from Sixt at Sants station around 1100 and drove back to our AirBnB to load the luggage. On our way out of Barcelona, we stopped at Montjuic to see the nice view from the cable car and visit an art museum\[^joan-miro-foundation\] I had been to last time. We parked the car on a busy street full of cars right next to the cable car station in broad daylight and with no valuables visible from any window in the car, so we felt pretty safe about it. We got on the cable car around 1400. After the cable car, we crossed the road to see the museum and ate lunch there.

Returning to the car around 1600, we were shocked to see the two driver side quarter windows had been smashed.

What we found waiting for us

Opening the doors, we saw the rear seats had been folded down to access the boot, and all our backpacks were gone. The suitcases were strewn all over the place but remained closed, and other items like water bottles and shopping were still there.

Taking stock of the loss, we realised something major: I had transferred my Passport and BRP[1](#fn1) from the safe at the AirBnB into my backpack when we checked out, so my travel documents were also gone. To me more precise **all** my possessions were gone since I only travel with a backpack: my laptop, clothes, bank cards that weren’t in my wallet, etc. My dad and sister were robbed of their backpacks as well, which included their laptops, cameras with years of photos, bank cards, etc. They travel with suitcases so they retained some of their possessions, and they had carried their travel documents with them, so they weren’t in as dire a situation as I suddenly was.

We had all been robbed and suffered a massive financial and personal loss, but I alone was **stranded**.

Obviously we had a bit of a meltdown, got it back together again and started calling up all the banks to cancel cards. We asked around the cable car station if they had seen anything since our car was directly in their view but had no luck there. They hadn’t even heard a car alarm - probably because the car wasn’t equipped with an alarm, as we now realised the telltale alarm indicator wasn’t present in the car. We called the police, who would not come to our location and told us to drive to the nearest police station. Around 1700, we cleared the broken glass from the seats and drove to the police station. On the drive to the police station, I [reported the BRP stolen](https://www.biometric-residence-permit.service.gov.uk/lost-stolen/where?hof-cookie-check).

We waited at the police station for 4 hours before someone saw us and took our statements, producing a police report in spanish they could not translate for us. Whilst we waited, we continued to call banks to cancel cards, and start to figure out what the process would be for me to return home. As phones started to die (all cables, chargers, battery packs were in our backpacks), we picked up some chargers from a nearby shop. We heard the stories of other tourists there, many of whom had been robbed in the same areas as us, on roads we had walked earlier in the day. Everyone we spoke to in the city, from the police to the cable car staff, gave us sympathetic looks and told us Barcelona and Montjuic is notorious for such thefts. How had we, and all these other tourists, not known?

I started informing people of what had happened whilst we waited. The sympathies I received were nice but what I really needed was a process. Luckily someone found [this blog post](https://gsravya.blogspot.com/2015/05/how-do-we-get-back-home-from-barcelona.html) with remarkably similar circumstances which became our guiding light.

We finally got our police reports around 2200 and rushed to the Sixt office at Sants before they closed. We explained our story, returned our car to them and got a new car as we had accomodation booked at the other cities and it was soon to be the weekend, so we decided continue our trip. Since it was too late to drive to Costa Brava, we booked into a hotel in Barcelona for the night and were up most of the time making calls and reading online to try to figure out what to do next.

## Day 1 - Friday 20th December

The first thing I needed was a new passport. In the morning I called the Indian embassy emergency helpline and spoke to a helpful visa officer who explained the process to me. He told me the Indian embassy in Spain is in Madrid, but there is an Indian passport and visa application centre run by VFS[2](#fn2) in Barcelona where I should go and apply for a new passport. As it turned out, the officer was on his way to Barcelona, so I was able to meet him at the application centre. We arrived there first thing and were able to explain our case to a sympathetic employee who bumped us to the front of the very large queue and started helping us. After filling in the online form, emailing photocopies of my old passport, and writting a little letter to explain my case, we submitted the application. The passport would be prepared by Monday, and the fastest way to get it was to pick it up from the embassy in Madrid.

We then went to the British consulate in Barcelona to try our luck. The security guard wouldn’t let us speak to anyone inside and misinformed us that we could apply for a new BRP in Madrid and would receive it within 2 days. These, I later found out, were the instructions for a new passport. Other than false hope, we also left with a piece of paper that instructed me to write to [BRPLost@homeoffice.gov.uk](mailto:BRPLost@homeoffice.gov.uk) to with my circumstances. I received a reply later in the day from the Lost & Stolen team that my BRP had been cancelled, and [instructions on what to do next](https://www.gov.uk/biometric-residence-permits/lost-stolen-damaged).

There was nothing further to do until Monday, we went to do some clothes shopping, buy some chargers, and made our way to Costa Brava.

, along with the information we learned from the UKVI[3](#fn3) international helpline. Note that this service costs £1.37/minute - I have spent at least £30 on it at the time of writing. Breakdown of costs at the end.

### The Process

The process was:

1.  Get a new passport
2.  Apply for a BRP replacement visa online
3.  Book an appointment with the nearest visa application centre (VAC) to submit biometrics, documents, and passport
4.  Wait for a decision from the decision making centre (DMC) - normally 15 working days but you can pay to reduce it to 5 (estimated only, not guaranteed)
5.  Collect or have delivered the passport once returned to the VAC
6.  Travel back to the UK
7.  Apply for a replacement BRP

We had already kicked off step 1 here, so we brainstormed what to do about the rest. Matters were severely complicated by the time of year, as there were numerous public holidays meaning working days were few and far between. To add to this, the Madrid VAC has even more generous holidays than the public, and very limited opening hours even on a normal day.

Here’s what the calendar looked like:

After this, there are no more public holidays January. Thus, we _had_ to submit the BRP replacement visa application on 23rd or 24th before 1200, else we would be waiting till 27th to start the 5 working day count.

## Days 2 - Saturday 21st December

We felt a huge sense of relief at leaving Barcelona, and greatly appreciated our quiet and relaxing time in Costa Brava. We continued to read online and make calls to deal with the fallout of this robbery, and altered our plans for the rest of the trip given the new information we had learned. In the afternoon, we left for Valencia.

## Day 3 - Sunday 22nd December

After a nice day and half of exploring Valencia, eating Paella and drinking Horchata, we made preparations for our new plan. We would return the car in Valencia instead of driving back to Barcelona. My mum & sister would take the train to Barcelona and fly back to London as planned, whilst my dad & I would take the train to Madrid and continue the process. We bought the train tickets, made sure we had planned every minute of the very important next day, and ran through all our plans to be as prepared as possible.

## Day 4 - Monday 23rd December

This was the day that it all happened. Dad & I said goodbye to mum and sis at Valencia and boarded our train to Madrid. I called the Indian embassy, who informed me my passport hadn’t arrived yet as it was on it’s way over from Barcelona and would be there by 11. We would arrive around the same time, so we planned to go straight to the embassy and try to expedite the passport.

The new passport (or at least it’s details) was key, as I could not get an appointment with the VAC before submitting an online application with the UKVI, and I could not complete this application without a passport number and expiry date. The Indian embassy were very kind and accomodating, and got the passport done well ahead of the expectation of 1600 they had set in our minds. They even let me print off a bunch of documents for my UK visa application, and sat and chatted with us whilst we waited. Luck was on our side, and we walked out of there around 1230 with a new passport.

Jumping into a cab, we went straight to the VAC which was 10 minutes up the road whilst I submitted the UK visa application online. I paid and got to the appointment booking state but as luck would have it, there were none available for days.

Since we weren’t expecting to get a passport so early, I had made arrangements to try talk my way into the VAC and secure an appointment in the evening so I could come back as soon as my passport was ready. I’m a veteran visa applicant and have paid lots of money to VFS and TLScontact[4](#fn4) over the years, so I had some idea about the kind of gatekeeping I would experience at the door when I got there without an appointment booked or an online application. I had lined up a few good spanish speaking friends who understood my situation well, and when the security guard didn’t want to engage with my poor spanish and looks of desparation, I called up my friend Tomas who was available at the time and handed over the phone. A long conversation ensued, but didn’t seem to be going our way. In my panic to engage the security guard, I had simply rung up my friend and passed the phone, forgetting to explain the _really important update_ that I had now submitted an online application. My friend tried long and hard to convince the guard to let me in, but he was firm in his position that I needed to submit an application online before he could do so. I picked up on this and desperately tried to get the phone back to explain to my friend that I had what he wanted, but it just wasn’t happening as the conversation was getting quite intense. Thanks for trying Tomas!

Then came a lucky break ![:pray:](Having%20my%20BRP%20and%20Passport%20stolen%20in%20Barcelona%20-%20~_Adi_files/1f64f.png ":pray:")

The door opened as someone was leaving the VAC. Dad caught the eye of someone wearing a lanyard inside and conveyed enough of a sense of our desparation that the employee came to the door to investigate. Luckily he spoke english and we explained our case. Once he learned we had submitted an online application, all barriers were gone and he immediately let us in, and started processing my case. This lucky break would not have been possible without Dad’s quick and decisive engagement of the employee inside, it’s entirely due to this moment that we were able to submit the visa application on 23rd itself. Thanks Dad! ![:muscle:](Having%20my%20BRP%20and%20Passport%20stolen%20in%20Barcelona%20-%20~_Adi_files/1f4aa.png ":muscle:")

Once inside, I was told I had to print off my application form. Strange - it was submitted online to the UKVI, and all my documents were also going to be scanned and uploaded so why did I need to print off the form? ![:thinking:](Having%20my%20BRP%20and%20Passport%20stolen%20in%20Barcelona%20-%20~_Adi_files/1f914.png ":thinking:")

Furthermore, the end screen of the online application had stated the following:

![](Having%20my%20BRP%20and%20Passport%20stolen%20in%20Barcelona%20-%20~_Adi_files/download-application-form.png)

I guess it was not optional after all. I ran sprinted to a nearby print shop and printed this off. On returning, I had to pay:

*   `€110.00` for a `Flexi Appointment` - This allowed me to submit the application any time of the day without booking an appointment (which I had already defaulted to by showing up to the VAC without an appointment)
*   `€67.98` as the `User Pays Fee` - from what I can infer, this is the taking of biometrics, submitting them and the scanned documents online, and sending the passport.
*   `€35.09` for the `Upgrade to the assisted service` - this is for someone to take your documents and scan them, else you must operate the scanner yourself. I’ve never seen this self-service option before but didn’t want to faff about with a scanner ![:man_shrugging:](Having%20my%20BRP%20and%20Passport%20stolen%20in%20Barcelona%20-%20~_Adi_files/1f937-2642.png ":man_shrugging:")

The lady processing my documents inside was kind enough to allow me to use her printer this time ![:roll_eyes:](Having%20my%20BRP%20and%20Passport%20stolen%20in%20Barcelona%20-%20~_Adi_files/1f644.png ":roll_eyes:") to print some final supporting documentation that had just been prepared by my company to strengthen my case, including documents from the initial BRP application for my Tier-2 visa with them.

I submitted my visa application, passport, documents, and biometrics at the Madrid VAC on 23rd December, via the priority service which states:

![](Having%20my%20BRP%20and%20Passport%20stolen%20in%20Barcelona%20-%20~_Adi_files/priority-time.png) [_Source_](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visa-decision-waiting-times-applications-outside-the-uk#faster)

When does this period start and end? ![](Having%20my%20BRP%20and%20Passport%20stolen%20in%20Barcelona%20-%20~_Adi_files/processing-time.png) [_Source_](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visa-decision-waiting-times-applications-outside-the-uk#when-your-applications-processing-time-starts-and-ends)

After completing all the steps at the VAC, I left with a sense of relief that the hard part was done, and now we just had to wait 5 working days before I could return home.

## Day 5 - 24th December

I was extremely lucky to have my friend Eleni living in Madrid who was away for the holidays and she was incredibly kind in allowing Dad & I to stay at their place till they returned in the second week of January. Thanks Eleni!

I received an email around 1100 informing me they had received my application. Some excerpts from the message:

> Your online application has been received at the UK Decision Making Centre. Your application is currently being prepared for consideration by an Entry Clearance Officer.

> If you have paid for Priority Service, your application will be placed in front of the queue and assessed ahead of other non-priority visa applications others but may still take 12 weeks to conclude if we require further time to consider the application. As indicated in the terms of service, the amount paid for the priority service, as well as the visa fees, is not refundable if the visa application is refused or if the decision is delayed.

## Day 12 - 31st December

My dad stayed with me till 31st as flights back to London more than doubled in cost after that, and we expected me to be back by then, or very soon after. It was great to have him around the first 10 days in Madrid and we got into a nice routine of running in the morning, walking around town during the day, cooking in the evening, and ending the day with a documentary. Thanks Dad!

## Day 14 - 2nd January

I was expecting a decision on 31st (the 5th working day), but figured they UKVI may be operating a bit slow due to the holidays so waited till the next working day to call the helpline. In any case, the VAC was closed after 1200 so even if they had sent back my passport with the visa in the morning, I would not be able to collect it on the day.

The helpline were not able to provide me with any more than informing me my application was `awaiting decision` and although the 5 working days I had paid for had passed, I had **no way to escalate until I had not heard anything for 15 working days**. I was supposed to be back at work so was working remotely which helped take my mind off things but I must have been refreshing my emails every 5 minutes to no avail.

## Day 15 - 3rd January

This experience is still ongoing, I’m writing this as I’m waiting in Madrid to hear something back from the UKVI.

I called the UKVI helpline again and this time received the optimistic news that a decision had been made. They were unable to provide any other specific information as the _only_ thing they can see is that a decision has been made. They cannot tell you:

*   whether or not the decision is approval
*   when the decision was made
*   whether or not the passport has been dispatched
*   when it will arrive at the VAC

They also cannot provide you with any written confirmation of that the decision has been made, so I had to wait for an email from either the DMC or VAC. They were unable to clarify whether this email would be sent by the DMC or VAC, at what point in the process it would be sent so all I know is that _at some point_, _someone_ will email me telling me one of the following:

*   the decision has been made
*   the passport has been dispatched back to Madrid
*   the passport has been received in Madrid and is ready for collection
